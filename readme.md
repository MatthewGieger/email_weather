# USE CASE
  My father asked me if he could receive a daily text with a useful weather forecast. After looking for such a service, all sms forecasts were pretty pathetic, thus email_weather was born.

# DESCRIPTION:
  A simple python program that fetches weather data from WeatherUnderground via the weatherunderground api and emails it out.

# REQUIREMENTS:
  Python 2
  Weather Underground API Key (can be created for free here: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)

# INSTALLATION/CONFIGURATION:
  1.  Create a settings.py file in the roor project directory.
  2.  Edit settings.py to your liking using settings_example.py as a template or reference.
  3.  Run "python main.py" from the terminal.
